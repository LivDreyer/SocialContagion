LEGEND:

NODES:
blue    - adopted negative vaccination sentiment by social exposure only *or* social + general
orange  - adopted negative vaccination sentiment by general exposure only

EDGES:
black      - negative vaccination sentiment DID NOT spread across this edge 
gray       - negative vaccination sentiment DID NOT spread across this edge *AND* this edge was rewired during network initialization     
blue       - negative vaccination sentiment spread across this edge
light blue - negative vaccination sentiment spread across this edge *AND* this edge was rewired during network initialization
        

NOTE: Low degree nodes tend towards the center while high degree nodes tend toward the perimeter. More concretely, gravitational forces are inversely proportional to the degree of the node.

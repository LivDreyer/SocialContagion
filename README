IV. Additional Files
     
     i.   Example (6) Gephi 0.8.1-beta images of the final-stage unvaccinated community                     network (before and after non-social edge removal) 
            • Only unvaccinated individuals
            • Node color delineates the cause of adoption
            • Edge color delineates its participation in social contagion
            • Edge color delineates whether it was rewired during network initialization
 
            N      = 5000
            k      = 10
            p      = [0.0, 0.1, 0.9]
            f(v-)  = 0.10  

     ii.  Example of (4×2×2=16) heatmaps of the Arithmetic Mean of the Number of                      Susceptible Communities and Final Epidemic Sizes

            k      = 10
            p      = [0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9]
            f(v-)  = 0.10

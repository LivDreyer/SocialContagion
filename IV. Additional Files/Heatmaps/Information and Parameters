Heatmaps:

I.  Arithmetic Mean of the Number of Susceptible Communities (p = [0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.99])
    - 100 simulated networks and opinion spreading processes per square

II. Arithmetic Mean of the Final Epidemic Size (p = [0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.99])
    - 100 simulated networks and opinion spreading processes per square
    - 50 simulated biological epidemics per network and period of opinion formation

Constants:
- N     = 5000
- k     = 10
- f(v-) = 0.10
